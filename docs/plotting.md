# Interactive Plotting Window

The Z2n software has a special window for interactive plotting of the periodogram, just type `plot` on the program, for more information on the usage type `help`.

```python
        Interactive plotting window of the Z2n Software.
        Type "help" for more information.

(plt) >>>
```

You can verify if you are interacting with the periodogram itself or the plot figure at any point by checking the prefix on the terminal.

```python
(z2n) >>> 'Interacting with the periodogram'

(plt) >>> 'Interacting with the plot figure'
```
